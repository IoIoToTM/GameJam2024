Game created for the 2024 global game jam I participated in. This is the code as is, haven't touched it since the jam. Fell free to use it as you see fit, learn from it, or whatever you want. Made in Unity.

I mean, it's very broken, uses a library and controler that almost no one uses, and is very bare bones, but hey, it's something. The theme was "Make me laugh", so the game is very nonserious and silly.
